Alabama
-------
Election results from the Alabama Secretary of State Elections Division (https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data). 

Incorrect or incomplete data was replaced using the county canvass reports for the following counties: Blount, Bullock, Dallas, Escambia, Greene, Hale, Jackson, Jefferson, Lamar, Lawrence, Marion, Pickens, Randolph, Russell, St. Clair, Shelby, Washington, Wilcox.

Absentee and provisional ballots were reported countywide in all counties. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote. Mobile County also reported only countywide totals for write in votes. These were distributed to precincts based on the difference between the number of ballots cast and the total votes reported for named candidates.

Note that the precinct results from DeKalb County add up to a higher total number of votes than the countywide totals certified by the state canvass. At the presidential level the difference is: Clinton (D) 60, Trump (R) 374, Johnson (L) 11, Stein (G) 4, Write In 3.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release, except the following counties use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Baldwin, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Franklin, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Madison, Marengo, Marshall, Mobile, Morgan, St. Clair, Shelby, Talladega, Tuscaloosa.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, municipal boundaries, or commission districts. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2016 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2016 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries bear little resemblance to the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Many precincts have outdated names in the Census VTDs. The Census VTDs also have at least some precinct names in wrong locations for the following counties: Clarke, Clay, Cleburne, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Jefferson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, Russell, Tallapoosa, Walker, Washington, Wilcox. Moreover, many precinct numbers and consequently the VTD GeoIDs are also incorrect throughout much of the state in the Census shapefiles. All precinct names and numbers have been edited to match the 2016 voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2016 election results.

Autauga: Merge Boone's Chapel/County Line

Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD.

--------
Election results from the Colorado Secretary of State (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Archives.html)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Chaffee, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Pitkin, Pueblo, Summit, Weld.

Las Animas County precinct assignments in the voter file differ markedly from both the Census VTD boundaries and from maps received from the county. All precincts were revised to match the geocoded voter file and the list of districts assigned to precinct splits. As appropriate, precinct boundaries were revised using Census blocks, the Trinidad municipal boundary shapefile, school district or fire district boundaries, and the parcel shapefile from the Las Animas County Assessor.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2016 precinct boundaries:

Lake: Revise Precincts 1/4, 2/3 to reverse 2017 redraw
Logan: Align Sterling City precincts with city limits
Montezuma: Precincts renumbered to match county maps
Otero: Align La Junta City precincts with county maps
Prowers: All precincts adjusted to match county maps
Rio Grande: Adjust Precincts 2/3 to match county maps

Larimer County reported provisional votes countywide. These were distributed to precincts by candidate based on their share of the vote reported by precinct.

Florida
-------
Election results from Florida Division of Elections (http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/)

Precinct shapefile from many sources.

The starting point was the Orlando Sentinel's precinct map for the 2016 presidential primary (http://interactive.orlandosentinel.com/elections/2016/presidential-primary/results/dem.html).

Hillsborough, Lake, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, and Pinellas Counties were updated directly with shapefiles downloaded from county Supervisor of Elections websites.

Brevard, Marion, and Putnam Counties were updated with KML files from the respective county Supervisor of Elections websites, from their election result map pages.

Columbia, DeSoto, Leon, Polk, and Osceola Counties updates received from Supervisor of Elections websites through personal contact.

Highlands, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, and Volusia Counties had some precinct mergers, which were determined based on visual inspection of PDF precinct maps from the county websites.

Charlotte, Hendry, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Levy, Madison, and Walton Counties are from VTDs released by the Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Program.

Hernando 99, Collier 450, and Palm Beach 8001/8002 are UOCAVA precincts with no real geography and votes were not redistributed.

Precinct names were adjusted to align with the formatting used in the voter registration file (e.g., some precincts have leading spaces).

Precinct shapefile primarily from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx)

Fulton County uses shapefiles and maps sourced from the county GIS program. Precincts CH01/CH04B, CP07A/CP07D, SS29A/SS29B, UC031/UC035 were merged to match how voters were registered in the 2016 voter file.

The following precincts were split by congressional district to match the 2016 election results: Avondale High, Glennwood, Wadsworth in Dekalb County; Cates D in Gwinnett County.

Cloudland and Teloga precincts in Chattooga County were split along the ridgeline that marks the boundary between them with the USGS Topographic Contour shapefile.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only has one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

In Wilkes County the boundary between Precinct 1 and Precinct 2A was aligned with the voter file.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used maps sourced from the respective county governments instead: DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Will.

Some counties used the Census Redistricting shapefiles as a starting point, but were corrected using PDF maps to reverse changes made since 2016. These include Champaign, Greene, Hancock, Kane, Knox, LaSalle, Lawrence, Mason, St. Clair, Will, and Winnebago Counties.

Countywide votes were distributed for Coles, Knox, Macon, McDonough, Tazewell. It was just a single vote in each of Knox, Macon, Tazewell; 3 votes in McDonough; and 30 votes in Coles.

The SBOE results do not include write-in votes by precinct for 42 counties. For these counties the write-in votes by precinct are transcribed from the official county or city canvass reports.

Indiana
-------
Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-in/). 

Incorrect or incomplete data was replaced using the county canvass reports for the following counties: Clark, Clinton, Dearborn, DeKalb, Delaware, Grant, Greene, Hancock, Howard, Huntington, Jasper, Jefferson, Johnson, Knox, Marion, Montgomery, Morgan, Newton, Noble, Perry, Posey, Putnam, Steuben, Switzerland, Tipton, Vermillion, Vigo.

Provisional votes and/or overseas ballots were reported countywide in Cass, Floyd, Hamilton, Hancock, Harrison, Monroe, and Wayne. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The initial precinct shapefile was provided by the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division (https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/). However, many counties featured outdated or inaccurate precinct boundaries usually related to changes in corporate boundaries. The correct 2016 precinct boundaries were identified using GIS maps from each county. As appropriate, precinct boundaries for the following counties were replaced using either the 2018 or 2020 release of the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Where necessary, boundaries were further edited to align with the 2016 corporate boundaries as determined via county parcel records. 

Adams, Allen, Bartholomew, Boone, Clark, Clinton, Daviess, Dearborn, Decatur, DeKalb, Delaware, Dubois, Fayette, Floyd, Fountain, Franklin, Fulton, Gibson, Greene, Hamilton, Hancock, Harrison, Hendricks, Henry, Howard, Huntington, Jackson, Jay, Jefferson, Jennings, Johnson, Kosciusko, Lake, Marion, Monroe, Montgomery, Ohio, Perry, Posey, Rush, Scott, Shelby, St. Joseph, Sullivan, Tipton, Vigo, Warrick, Wayne, Wells, Whitley.

Precinct shapefile from IA Secretary of State: https://sos.iowa.gov/shapefiles/

The Iowa Democratic Party did not report individual vote tallies for the 2016 Iowa caucuses. The caucus results are State Delegate Equivalents that represent the number of state convention delegates that the candidates received based on the caucus results. The SDE figures are multiplied by 100 following the standard practice of the Associated Press since precinct-level SDE figures are provided as very small fractions in the actual caucus reports.

The precinct results do not include the state delegates awarded via satellite locations for participants with hardship exceptions or via tele-caucus for voters abroad. The satellite locations awarded 2 state delegates to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders. The tele-caucus awarded 1 state delegate to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders.

The following precincts were merged to match the 2016 caucus results:

Appanoose: Udell/Union
Black Hawk: Cedar Falls W2P2/Cedar Falls Twp
Des Moines: Burlington 1/Tama, Burlington 8/Concordia
Fremont: Hamburg/Washington, Farragut/Shenandoah1

Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell, Lewiston, Portland, Saco, Sanford, South Portland, Westbrook.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Voting District shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County Subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Waterville as statewide votes are not reported by ward. VTDs for Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported at the township level for Auburn, Lewiston, Gorham, Harpswell, Portland, Westbrook, Augusta, Belfast, Sanford, South Portland. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the township vote for each candidate. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported at the state level. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the statewide vote for each candidate.

For Biddeford, Ellsworth, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland write-in votes reported at the township level were apportioned to precincts in the same shares that the total vote was split among precincts within the township.

The state reported 987 votes from Portland for Jill Stein (G). The precinct-level votes in the Portland city report add up to 995 total votes for Stein.

Maine includes more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

Precinct shapefile from the Michigan Department of State (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8ce0f3ce3ff74109ac02a26d34a0f4fc_1)

Michigan has cities split across counties. Two are relevant to their reported election results versus the precinct map (which did not make the split), Fenton and Richmond. Those precincts were merged to reflect the precinct map.

Most counties had "statistical adjustments" that were at the county level, rather than the precinct level. Only two were for party candidates (Huron and Kalkaka), and in those cases, two or fewer votes. The remaining cases were related to "other" votes. Due to the scattered nature of "other" votes, these votes are apportioned to precincts by the split of total votes of precincts within the county.

Detroit allows for absentee votes to be reported by Absentee Voter Counting Boards, which generally contain multiple precincts. These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the non-AVCB vote was split among precincts within a county. The linkage between election precinct and AVCB was provided by OpenElections via Derek Willis. Precinct 176 was listed as split between AVCB 37 and AVCB 158, the only precinct in the city that was listed as split. AVCB 158 has no other precinct assigned to it, so all votes went to precinct 176. However, this was a very low number of votes relative to the other AVCBs, so for ease of calculation, 176 was treated as a normal member of AVCB 37 in the disaggregation calculation described above.

Election results from OpenElections, gathered from county elections officials.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. 

Adams, Antelope, Box Butte, Buffalo, Burt, Butler, Cass, Chase, Cherry, Cuming, Dakota, Dawes, Dawson, Deuel, Douglas, Garfield, Hamilton, Harlan, Holt, Kearney, Keith, Keya Paha, Kimball, Lancaster, Madison, Merrick, Otoe, Perkins, Platte, Red Willow, Richardson, Saline, Sarpy, Seward, Stanton, Valley, and Washington either used a replacement shapefile or, more often, required tweaks based on PDF maps from county election officials.

Some counties reported one or more classes of votes at the county level. These were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote.

Write-in votes were inconsistently provided by the counties, so they were excluded. Unofficial precinct results from NE Secretary of State used as a cross-reference in places.

Election results from Nevada Secretary of State (https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information/precinct-level-results)

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Clark, Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, Lincoln, Lyon, Washoe.

County borders in all county-sourced shapefiles were aligned to the U.S Census Bureau's boundaries. Minor adjustments were made in the Precinct 1/3 boundary of Eureka County and in the Precinct 6/5 boundary of Pershing County to match county GIS maps. Substantial revisions were made in the Fallon area of Churchill County and in the Tonopah area of Nye County to match county PDF maps.

Countywide-reported votes for Carson City, Churchill, Clark, Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, Lyon, Nye, Pershing, Washoe, and White Pine were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote. Clark County had congressional district-reported votes that were distributed accordingly.

The state election results by precinct do not include precinct votes by candidate for precincts with less than 10 total votes cast. For Douglas and Washoe, these were transferred from the county precinct reports. For Churchill, Elko, Esmeralda, Humboldt, Lyon, Mineral, Nye, Pershing, Storey, and White Pine these were inferred from the countywide totals. Clark County was also inferred from countywide totals, but using additional party registration information as of Nov 5, 2016 with slight adjustments to match total ballots cast per precinct.

New Jersey
----------
Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-nj/). Results from Burlington, Camden, Middlesex, and Warren counties were partly or wholly replaced using the Statement of the Vote from the respective counties.

Precinct shapefile from New Jersey Geographic Information Network (https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/election-districts-for-new-jersey). Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County was added as an unassigned district.

All counties except Middlesex, Sussex, and Warren report mail votes and provisional votes at the municipal and/or ward level. Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union further subdivide these vote types by other districts on the same ballot. Camden, Cape May, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, and Warren report overseas ballots countywide or by congressional district. All votes were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote of the respective reporting unit.

The following modifications to the shapefile were made to reverse changes in precinct boundaries enacted since 2016:

Gloucester: Merge Glassboro 1/13
Hudson: Merge Jersey City Ward E 9/24, 6/25; Realign Union City Ward 9 precincts
Passaic: Merge Pompton Lakes 3/6

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

Until the 2016 general election North Carolina also produced another results-sorted data set that assigned votes by Census VTD. Since NC precinct boundaries are now produced using Census blocks and are therefore interchangeable with VTDs the series was discontinued. The statistical "noise" added to the results-sorted data was greater than that added to the precinct-sorted data in some counties and lesser than that added to the precinct-sorted data in other counties.

For the 2016 general election 29 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. These precinct results were therefore used for the following counties.

Alamance, Alexander, Alleghany, Burke, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Craven, Franklin, Graham, Granville, Hoke, Iredell, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Montgomery, Person, Randolph, Rockingham, Rowan, Rutherford, Stanly, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Vance, Warren, Yancey

The results-sorted data had less noise than the precinct-sorted data in following 45 counties.

Beaufort, Brunswick, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caswell, Catawba*, Cumberland, Currituck, Davidson, Davie, Duplin, Durham*, Forsyth, Greene, Guilford, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hyde, Jackson*, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lenoir*, Lincoln, Macon, Moore, Nash, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pasquotank, Pender, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Sampson, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell, Wayne, Wilkes, Yadkin

The precinct-sorted data had less noise than the results-sorted data in the following 26 counties.

Anson, Ashe, Avery, Bertie*, Bladen, Caldwell, Camden, Carteret*, Chatham, Chowan, Columbus, Dare, Edgecombe, Gaston, Gates*, Hertford, Martin*, Mecklenburg*, Northampton*, Orange, Perquimans*, Robeson*, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wilson

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the results-sorted or precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The results-sorted or  precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

For some counties the results-sorted data includes combined precincts are adds unsorted votes to one of the precinct line items. Where the results-sorted data otherwise contained less noise than the precinct-sorted data then the precinct-sorted data was used instead only for these precincts: Buncombe 05.1/56.2/68.1, Catawba 29, Cumberland CC17/CC31, Forsyth 402/403, Guilford G42B, New Hanover W03/W21, Scotland 09/10.

Oregon
------
Election results from the Oregon Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/). Results from Polk, Tillamook, Wallowa, and Wasco counties were corrected with the respective county reports.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were obtained from the following counties: Benton, Columbia, Coos, Crook, Curry, Deschutes, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath, Lane, Linn, Malheur, Morrow, Multnomah, Polk, Sherman, Tillamook, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wasco, Washington, Yamhill.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were provided by the Oregon Secretary of State's office for the following counties: Clatsop, Hood River, Jefferson, Marion. The Marion County shapefile included numerous gaps that were assigned based on the Precinct Split Summary report from the county clerk's office. Precincts along the Salem/Kaiser border were revised with the corrected municipal boundaries from the Marion County 2019 precinct shapefile.

The 2016 precinct shapefile for Clackamas County was provided by the Metro Regional Government Data Resource Center.

Precinct boundaries for Grant County and Wheeler County are defined by school district boundaries. Precinct shapefiles were produced to match PDF maps provided by the respective counties using the 2016 Oregon Education Boundaries shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were produced based on PDF maps provided by the respective counties: Baker, Gilliam, Lake, Lincoln. Boundaries defined by the PLSS grid were produced with the Oregon Public Land Survey Quarter-Quarter Reference Grid shapefile obtained from the Oregon spatial Data Library. Municipal boundaries were produced from the Oregon Department of Transportion 2016 City Limits shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Street boundaries are produced from the U.S. Census Bureau's census block shapefiles.

PDF maps obtained from Lake County are approximate precinct boundaries drawn on the PLSS grid for county precincts and on the street map for Lakeview city precincts. These boundaries were adjusted to match address range assignments in the Lake County Address Library Report which serves as the legal definition of the precincts according to the Lake County Clerk. Precinct divisions for roads that cross multiple rural precincts are generally defined by zip codes. Address ranges were further identified based on the Lake County tax lot parcel viewer.

Rural precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Coos County and Union County were revised to match the updated PLSS cadastral grid in the Oregon GIS Framework obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. 

Municipal precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Tillamook County and Umatilla County were revised to reverse annexations that were not yet in effect for the November 2016 general election. 

The boundaries of precincts 14, 37, 45, 49 in the Deschutes County shapefile were revised to match legislative district assignments.

Pennsylvania
------------
Election results from the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-pa/). Precinct data was corrected with canvass reports for the following counties: Cumberland, Elk, Lancaster, Northampton, Susquehanna. The candidate totals for Northampton and Susquehanna differ from the county totals reported by the state and therefore the statewide totals differ from the official results accordingly.

Allegheny County reported president-only votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The shapefiles from Delaware County and the City of Pittsburgh are from the respective jurisdictions instead. Precinct numbers were corrected to match the voter file in the following locales: Allegheny (Elizabeth, Pittsburgh W12), Blair (Greenfield), Bradford (Athens), Greene (Nonongahela), Monroe (Smithfield), Montgomery (Hatfield), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Perry (Toboyne), Washington (New Eagle, Somerset), York (Fairview).

Precinct boundaries throughout the state were edited to match voter assignments in the PA Secretary of State voter file from the 2016 election cycle. While some edits reflect official updates to wards or divisions the great majority involve voters incorrectly assigned to voting districts by the counties. As such the VEST shapefile endeavors to reflect the de facto precinct boundaries and these often differ from the official voting district boundaries, in some cases quite drastically. Wherever possible edits were made using census boundaries or alternatively using the parcel shapefiles from the respective counties. 

In certain areas voter assignments appear so erratic that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. In general, municipal boundaries were retained except where significant numbers of numbers were misassigned to the wrong municipality. In cases where the odd/even split was incorrectly reversed for precinct boundary streets the official boundary was retained. All such cases involved near equal number of voters swapped between voting districts.

The following revisions were made to the base shapefiles to match the de facto 2016 precinct boundaries consistent with the voter file. Individual precincts are noted in cases of splits or merges. Due to the sheer number of edits boundary adjustments are noted at the borough/township level. There may be as many as two dozen individual precincts that were revised within a given municipality.

Election Results from South Dakota Secretary of State (https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/election-resources/election-history/2016_Election_History.aspx)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release, with the exceptions of Potter County and Yankton County from the 2010 Census VTD release.

Brookings, Brown, Hughes, Hyde, Potter, Sully, and Yankton use countywide vote centers rather than polling locations by precinct. South Dakota counties with vote centers do not record votes by precinct. For these counties, votes were apportioned to precincts based on their share of the countywide number of ballots cast by voters registered with the party of the respective candidates. When this method was tested with counties that report votes by precinct the great majority of precincts were within 4% of the actual candidate vote shares. However, a scattering of precincts deviated by as much as 12% from the actual vote shares. These precincts tend to be in either city centers or outlying areas, which reflects the fact that registered Democrats in rural precincts are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than registered Democrats in urban precincts.

Lawrence County reported absentee votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The certified precinct report from Minnehaha County adds up to about 18 more votes per office than the countywide totals recorded in the official state canvass. This was evidently an oversight in which the preliminary vote count from Minnehaha County was not updated before the final state canvass.

The following modifications were made in the shapefiles to recreate the 2016 precinct boundaries.

Virginia
--------
Election results from Virginia Department of Elections (https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/)

Absentee ballots and provisional votes were reported at the county or city level throughout the state. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Virginia election reports often include precinct splits that are obsolete or unused in practice. These have been omitted. In cases where voters were incorrectly assigned to the wrong district the de facto precinct split has been included for that election.

The following modifications were made to recreate the 2016 precinct boundaries.

Albemarle: Merge Cale/Biscuit Run, Free Bridge/Pantops; Add Belfield from 2010 VTD shapefile; Adjust Brownsville/Crozet to match 2010 VTD shapefile

Wisconsin
---------
Election results and precinct shapefile from Wisconsin State Legislature Open Data Portal (https://data-ltsb.opendata.arcgis.com/).

The shapefile used for the 2016 election results was the 2017 wards shapefile. The 2017 wards shapefile featured multiple changes and corrections to the ward boundaries what were already in effect for the November 2016 general election but were not in the January 2016 wards shapefile.

Several thousand votes were reported for the town of Menasha, which had almost entirely been incorporated into the village of Fox Crossing. The ward numbers in the Menasha results matched exactly the wards in Fox Crossing that didn't report any results, so the Menasha results were applied to Fox Crossing.

The following wards had been added due to annexations subsequent to the 2016 general election. They were merged back into the 2016 wards along with any associated election results.

Brown: Wrightstown 5
Clark: Abbotsford 7
Dane: DeForest 18, Sun Prairie 22
Eau Claire: Eau Claire 68
Fond du Lac: Fond du Lac 28
Green Lake: Green Lake 4
Kenosha: Kenosha 94
La Crosse: Holmen 12
Manitowoc: Manitowoc 29
Marathon: Wausau 48
Monroe: Tomah 21
Outagamie: Combined Locks 6, Kaukauna 13
Washington: Slinger 9
Waukesha: Sussex 10
Waupaca: Clintonville 9, 10
Winnebago: Menasha 39-42, Neenah 26

These additional changes were made to reflect the 2016 ward-by-ward results.

Grant: Split Platteville 8/9
Jefferson: Renumber Watertown 3 to Watertown 19
La Crosse: Split Holland 1 from Holmen 2
Winnebago: Relabel Fox Crossing 8-13 as Menasha 8-13

Note that the election results for Holland 1-6 and Holmen 1-11 in La Crosse County were reapportioned accordingly using the same whole population methodology as the WI Legislative Technology Services Bureau.
