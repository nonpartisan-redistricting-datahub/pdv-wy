Alabama
-------
Election results from the Alabama Secretary of State Elections Division (https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data). 

Absentee and provisional ballots were reported countywide in all counties. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefiles initially from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release, except the following counties use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Baldwin, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Franklin, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Madison, Marengo, Marshall, Mobile, Morgan, St. Clair, Shelby, Talladega, Tuscaloosa.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, municipal boundaries, or commission districts. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2020 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2020 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries bear little resemblance to the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Many precincts have outdated names in the Census VTDs. The Census VTDs also have at least some precinct names in wrong locations for the following counties: Clarke, Clay, Cleburne, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Jefferson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, Russell, Tallapoosa, Walker, Washington, Wilcox. Moreover, many precinct numbers and consequently the VTD GeoIDs are also incorrect throughout much of the state in the Census shapefiles. All precinct names and numbers have been edited to match the 2020 voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2020 election results.

Barbour: Split Eufaula between Bevill/CC/Fellowship/McCoo/Sanford/WB
Calhoun: Add precinct splits to Beats 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19, 22

Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD. Similarly, federal-only ballots that are reported at the statewide level were apportioned to precincts by candidate based on their share of the precinct-level vote.

Colorado
--------
Election results from the Colorado Secretary of State (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Archives.html)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Pitkin, Pueblo, Summit, Weld.

Las Animas County precinct assignments in the voter file differ markedly from both the Census VTD boundaries and from maps received from the county. All precincts were revised to match the geocoded voter file and the list of districts assigned to precinct splits. As appropriate, precinct boundaries were revised using Census blocks, the Trinidad municipal boundary shapefile, school district or fire district boundaries, and the parcel shapefile from the Las Animas County Assessor.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2020 precinct boundaries:

Logan: Align Sterling City precincts with city limits
Montezuma: Precincts renumbered to match county maps
Morgan: Split Precincts 1/18 to match county maps
Otero: Align La Junta City precincts with county maps

Georgia
-------
Election results from the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division (https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/current_and_past_elections_results). Presidential recount results from the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division via Reuters.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx). Cobb, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties instead use shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Forsyth and Fulton use shapefiles sourced from the respective counties.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only reports one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

The following additional modifications reflect changes made prior to the 2020 general election.

Cobb: Split Bells Ferry 3/4, Dobbins 1/2, Marietta 3A/3B, Smyrna 3A/3B

Maine
-----
Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Ellsworth, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Voting district shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Saco, Waterville, Westbrook as statewide votes were not reported by ward. VTDs for Ellsworth and Gorham were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported by township for Auburn, Augusta, Ellsworth, Gorham, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported statewide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level vote for the given reporting unit.

For Portland City the state reported 33786 votes for Joe Biden (D) and 6486 votes for Donald Trump (R). In the Senate election the state reported 28053 votes for Sara Gideon (D) and 8659 votes for Susan Collins (R). Amended precinct returns by Portland City add up to 33784 votes for Biden, 6483 votes for Trump, 28071 votes for Gideon, and 8656 votes for Collins.

Maine features more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

Michigan
--------
Election results from the Michigan Secretary of State (https://miboecfr.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cfr/precinct_srch.cgi)
Precinct shapefile from the Michigan GIS Open Data site (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/49eb37d0a4294924bf8ef5ffe0eac47e_6/)

Some counties report "Statistical Adjustments" with their precinct results, which can either be positive or negative. Many of these are related to cities that span county lines, as they often match precinct results of these county-spanning cities. In some cases these adjustments cancel each other out across the two counties that share the city, but some (notably Clinton County's East Lansing and Eaton County's Lansing adjustments) are not reciprocated, which introduces error to statewide totals. Other than these, there appears to be a handful of tiny adjustments that were made to make the precinct totals match official countywide totals. None of these adjustments of any type were distributed to precincts, which may result in candidate totals being slightly off official totals.

Write-in vote totals have been excluded, since in most cases, a large share of their votes are accounted for via statistical adjustments.

In several cases, cities that overlapped county lines reported results in each county, but the shapefile had a single precinct. These were split at the county line in the shapefile and the two sets of results assigned accordingly.
Claire city - Isabella/Clare
Brown city - Lapeer/Sanilac
Fenton city - Oakland/Genesee
Richmond city - St. Clair/Macomb

Berrien: the results for Sodus and St. Joseph townships appear to have been flipped, these were corrected
Ottawa: via contact with the Park Township clerk's office, precinct 9 in the state shapefile has been renumbered to precinct 4
Wayne: Detroit reports absentee votes via Absent Voter Counting Boards. The linkage file of boards to precincts is from OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-mi/tree/master/2020), and votes were distributed to precincts proportionally by election day vote.

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)

Buncombe 681, Henderson CV, Wake 01-07A, 07-07A are missing from the 20201018 shapefile. They are added from the 20190827 shapefile.

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

For the 2020 general election 51 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. The precinct-sorted data set was used instead for the counties listed below.

Alleghany, Avery, Beaufort, Bertie*, Bladen, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Davidson*, Davie, Duplin*, Durham*, Edgecombe, Guilford, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hertford, Hyde, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lincoln, Macon, Martin, Mecklenburg*, Moore, Nash, New Hanover*, Northampton*, Orange, Pasquotank, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell*, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes*, Yadkin

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

Vermont
-------
Election results from the Vermont Secretary of State (https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/)
Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program

The Census VTD shapefile features city wards. However, precinct boundaries for state and federal elections are not based on city wards. They are instead defined by legislative districts wherever they cross municipal boundaries. Therefore, city wards were merged in the shapefile and cities or townships were instead split into precincts wherever necessary using the state legislative district shapefile.

Vermont has four unorganized towns whose residents cast votes in neighboring towns. These were distributed back based on voting age population in the 2019 American Community Survey as 2020 Census results are not yet available at the township level. (Averill-Canaan, Buel's Gore-Huntington, Ferdinand-Brighton, Glastenbury-Shaftsbury.)
