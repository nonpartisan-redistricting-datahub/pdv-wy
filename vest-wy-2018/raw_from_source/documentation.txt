Alabama
-------
Election results from the Alabama Secretary of State Elections Division (https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data). 

Incorrect or incomplete data was replaced using the county canvass reports for the following counties: Dallas, Chilton, Covington, Escambia, Lauderdale, Monroe, Pickens, Russell.

Absentee and provisional ballots were reported countywide by all counties. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefiles initially from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release, except the following counties use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Baldwin, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Franklin, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Madison, Marengo, Marshall, Mobile, Montgomery, Morgan, St. Clair, Shelby, Talladega, Tuscaloosa.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, municipal boundaries, or commission districts. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2018 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2018 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries bear little resemblance to the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Many precincts have outdated names in the Census VTDs. The Census VTDs also have at least some precinct names in wrong locations for the following counties: Clarke, Clay, Cleburne, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Jefferson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, Russell, Tallapoosa, Walker, Washington, Wilcox. Moreover, many precinct numbers and consequently the VTD GeoIDs are also incorrect throughout much of the state in the Census shapefiles. All precinct names and numbers have been edited to match the 2018 voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2018 election results.

Barbour: Split Eufaula between Bevill/CC/Fellowship/McCoo/Sanford/WB
Calhoun: Add precinct splits to Beats 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 15, 19, 22

Election results from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/18GENR/index.php)
Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD. Similarly, federal-only ballots that are reported at the statewide level were apportioned to precincts by candidate based on their share of the precinct-level vote.

Arkansas
--------
Election results from Arkansas Secretary of State (https://www.sos.arkansas.gov/elections/research/election-results)

Precinct shapefile primarily from Jennifer Wheeler at the Arkansas GIS Office who provided an unreleased interim version of the statewide precinct shapefile with updated or corrected boundaries. Where noted below, the 2016 shapefile release from the Arkansas GIS Office was used to reverse changes not yet enacted for the 2018 election.

For Benton county the Secretary of State results combine the Precinct 41 votes with the Precinct 4 votes. These were corrected according to precinct reports received from the county.

Johnson County switched to new vote centers for the November 2018 election. Due to a coding mismatch votes were then incorrectly assigned to precincts in the Secretary of State results, indicating some precincts had almost no votes and others had far too many. For the purpose of assigning votes as accurately as possible, the precincts are merged according to their assigned vote center with results by vote center received from the county. Votes that were reported countywide were then distributed based on the number of ballots cast by precinct according to the voter statistics report also received from the county.

Countywide votes were distributed for Fulton, Jefferson, Johnson, Union. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct mergers were made in the following counties to match county reporting units: Carroll, Chicot, Clark, Crittenden, Dallas, Faulkner, Hot Spring, Howard, Independence, Johnson, Mississippi, Monroe, Nevada, Phillips, Poinsett, St. Francis, Stone.

Additional modifications to reflect how election results were reported:

Benton: Align Siloam Springs and Gravette precincts with 2018 municipal boundaries
Boone: Precinct splits based on municipal boundaries and legislative boundaries consistent with county map
Greene: Merged Wards 3/3A and 4/4C as the splits were not reported separately for the 2018 general election
Izard: Sage in Melbourne 4 and Oxford in Brockwell split by township shapefile
Jefferson: Precincts 6, 35, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 46, 52, 63, 129, 402, 411 from 2016 shapefile
Madison: County precincts outside Huntsville from 2016 shapefile
Phillips: Helena-West Helena wards added from city redistricting map; Precinct 4 was no longer in use for the 2018 general election, the single vote reported for Precinct 4 was actually from Precinct 6
St. Francis: Forrest City wards revised to match city PDF and legal description in municipal code
Stone: Ben 1 & Ben 2 split according to Secretary of State map

Colorado
--------
Election results from the Colorado Secretary of State (https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/Results/Archives.html)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Delta, Denver, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson, La Plata, Larimer, Mesa, Pitkin, Pueblo, Summit, Weld.

Las Animas County precinct assignments in the voter file differ markedly from both the Census VTD boundaries and from maps received from the county. All precincts were revised to match the geocoded voter file and the list of districts assigned to precinct splits. As appropriate, precinct boundaries were revised using Census blocks, the Trinidad municipal boundary shapefile, school district or fire district boundaries, and the parcel shapefile from the Las Animas County Assessor.

The following additional revisions were made to match the 2018 precinct boundaries:

Logan: Align Sterling City precincts with city limits
Montezuma: Precincts renumbered to match county maps
Otero: Align La Junta City precincts with county maps
Prowers: All precincts adjusted to match county maps
Rio Grande: Adjust Precincts 2/3 to match county maps

Florida
-------
Election results from the Florida Department of State (https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/)

Precinct results from several sources.
Alachua, Baker, Bay, Bradford, Brevard, Calhoun, Citrus, Clay, Dixie, Escambia, Hardee, Hendry, Hernando, Indian River, Lafayette and Sarasota come from the Department of State.
Broward, Desoto, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Gulf, Manatee, Marion, Martin, Monroe, Nassau, Pinellas, Polk, Putnam, Santa Rosa, St. Johns, St. Lucie, and Union are unchanged from the 2016 VEST shapefile.
Charlotte, Franklin, Glades, Hamilton, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Okeechobee, Orange, Seminole, Suwannee, Taylor, Wakulla, Walton, and Washinton come from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release.
Collier, Columbia, Duval, Flagler, Highlands, Hillsborough, Lake, Lee, Leon, Miami-Dade, Okaloosa, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Sumter, and Volusia come from the counties.

Brevard and Seminole reported votes in virtual and early precincts countywide, these were reapportioned by candidate based on the precinct reported vote.

Florida had recounts in several races this election, but the precinct-level results posted by the state report the counts prior to the recount in some cases, which makes the sum totals of columns in the shapefile slightly different than those found in the official statewide vote totals.

Georgia

Election results from the Georgia Secretary of State Elections Division(https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/current_and_past_elections_results)
Precinct shapefile primarily from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx)

Fulton County uses shapefiles and maps sourced from the county GIS program. Precincts CH01/CH04B, CP07A/CP07D, SS29A/SS29B, UC031/UC035 were merged to match how voters were registered in the 2018 voter file.

The following precincts were split by congressional district to match the 2018 election results: Avondale High, Glennwood, Wadsworth in Dekalb County; Cates D in Gwinnett County.

Cloudland and Teloga precincts in Chattooga County were split along the ridgeline that marks the boundary between them with the USGS Topographic Contour shapefile.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only has one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

In Wilkes County the boundary between Precinct 1 and Precinct 2A was aligned with the voter file.

Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-in/). 

Incorrect or incomplete data was replaced using the county canvass reports for the following counties: 

Bartholomew, Clark, Delaware, Dubois, Elkhart, Fayette, Floyd, Grant, Hamilton, Hendricks, Howard, Huntington, Jasper, Kosciusko, Lawrence, Newton, Ohio, Parke, Pulaski, Randolph, Ripley, St. Joseph, Steuben, Switzerland, Tipton, White.

Provisional votes and/or overseas ballots were reported countywide in Cass and Monroe. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The initial precinct shapefile was provided by the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division (https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/). However, many counties featured outdated or inaccurate precinct boundaries usually related to changes in corporate boundaries. The correct 2018 precinct boundaries were identified using GIS maps from each county. As appropriate, precinct boundaries for the following counties were replaced using either the 2018 or 2020 release of the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Where necessary, boundaries were further edited to align with the 2018 corporate boundaries as determined via county parcel records.

Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell, Lewiston, Portland, Saco, Sanford, South Portland, Westbrook.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Voting District shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County Subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Waterville as statewide votes are not reported by ward. VTDs for Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported at the township level for Auburn, Lewiston, Gorham, Harpswell, Portland, Westbrook, Augusta, Belfast, Sanford, South Portland. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the township vote for each candidate. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported at the state level. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the statewide vote for each candidate.

For Auburn, Biddeford, Lewiston write-in votes reported at the township level were apportioned to precincts in the same shares that the total vote was split among precincts within the township.

The state reported 4930 votes from Gorham for Angus King (I). The precinct-level votes in the Gorham city report add up to 4530 total votes for King. The state reported 4201 votes from Portland for Eric Brakey (R). The precinct-level votes in the Portland city report add up to 4200 total votes for Brakey.

Maine features more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

Election shapefile from Michigan GIS Open Data site (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2018-voting-precincts)

Detroit 125 does not appear in the state's shapefile. Looking at a PDF on the city's website, it looks like it is some part of 494, but the boundary is not clear, so these results were merged together.

A few counties use Absent Voter Counting Boards to report some or all absentee results. In some cases, these align with a single precinct, but in others, they correspond to multiple precincts. Notable in this is that all of Detroit uses AVCBs, of which each is made up of multiple precincts. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on election day totals. Thank you to Derek Willis of OpenElections for the file linking Detroit precincts to AVCBs.

Some counties report "Statistical Adjustments" with their precinct results which make the sum of the precinct totals match the official results. These can be positive or negative. In many cases these adjustments are small, but two cases are notable: Muskegon County has a +4630 adjustment for gubernatorial candidate Tood Schleiger and Barry County has a -722 adjustment for SBE candidate Tami Carlone. None of these adjustments, small or large, were distributed to precincts, which may result in candidate totals being slightly off official totals.

Write-in vote totals have been excluded, since in most cases, a large share of their votes are accounted for via statistical adjustments. (For example, 1647 of MSU Trustee candidate David Mott's 1673 votes are found in these countywide figures.)

Oakland County's Fenton precinct 2 results merged into Genesee County's Fenton precinct 2.
St. Clair County's Richmond precinct 1 results merged into Macomb County's Richmond precinct 1.

New Jersey
----------
Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-nj/). Results from Camden, Cape May, Essex, Hunterdon, and Salem counties were partly or wholly replaced using the Statement of the Vote from the respective counties.

Precinct shapefile from New Jersey Geographic Information Network (https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/election-districts-for-new-jersey). Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County was added as an unassigned district.

All counties except Middlesex, Sussex, and Warren report mail votes and provisional votes at the municipal and/or ward level. Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union further subdivide these vote types by other districts on the same ballot. Camden, Cape May, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Morris, Salem, and Sussex reported overseas ballots countywide or by congressional district. All votes were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote of the respective reporting unit.

The following modifications to the shapefile were made to reverse changes in precinct boundaries enacted since 2018:

Hudson: Merge Jersey City Ward E 9/24, 6/25

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

For the 2018 general election 39 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. The precinct-sorted data set was used instead for the counties listed below.

Ashe, Avery, Beaufort, Bertie, Bladen, Brunswick, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Camden, Caswell, Chatham, Chowan, Cumberland, Currituck, Dare*, Davidson, Davie, Duplin, Durham*, Edgecombe, Forsyth, Greene*, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hyde, Jackson, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lenoir, Lincoln, Macon*, Martin*, Mecklenburg, Moore, Nash, New Hanover*, Northampton*, Orange, Pamlico, Pender, Perquimans*, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Rutherford, Sampson, Scotland, Stanly*, Stokes, Surry, Tyrrell, Wake, Washington*, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes, Yadkin

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

Pennsylvania
------------
Election results from the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-pa/). Precinct data was corrected with canvass reports for the following counties: Berks, Blair, Bradford, Cambria, Carbon, Crawford, Elk, Forest, Franklin, Lawrence, Lycoming, Mifflin, Montgomery, Montour, Northumberland, Susquehanna. The candidate totals for Berks, Blair, Crawford, and Mifflin differ from the county totals reported by the state and therefore the statewide totals differ from the official results accordingly.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The shapefiles from Delaware County and the City of Pittsburgh are from the respective jurisdictions instead. Precinct numbers were corrected to match the voter file in the following locales: Allegheny (Elizabeth, Pittsburgh W12), Blair (Greenfield), Bradford (Athens), Greene (Nonongahela), Monroe (Smithfield), Montgomery (Hatfield), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Perry (Toboyne), Washington (New Eagle, Somerset), York (Fairview).

Precinct boundaries throughout the state were edited to match voter assignments in the PA Secretary of State voter file from the 2018 election cycle. While some edits reflect official updates to wards or divisions the great majority involve voters incorrectly assigned to voting districts by the counties. As such the VEST shapefile endeavors to reflect the de facto precinct boundaries and these often differ from the official voting district boundaries, in some cases quite drastically. Wherever possible edits were made using census boundaries or alternatively using the parcel shapefiles from the respective counties. 

In certain areas voter assignments appear so erratic that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. In general, municipal boundaries were retained except where significant numbers of numbers were misassigned to the wrong municipality. In cases where the odd/even split was incorrectly reversed for precinct boundary streets the official boundary was retained. All such cases involved near equal number of voters swapped between voting districts.

The following revisions were made to the base shapefiles to match the de facto 2018 precinct boundaries consistent with the voter file. Individual precincts are noted in cases of splits or merges. Due to the sheer number of edits boundary adjustments are noted at the borough/township level. There may be as many as two dozen individual precincts that were revised within a given municipality.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The Lando/Lansford precinct in Chester County was merged to match the 2018 election results.

Absentee, provisional, emergency, and failsafe results were reported countywide. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the county vote for each candidate.

In Spartanburg County the precinct labels for Trinity Methodist, Trinity Presbyterian, and West View Elementary were swapped to match the voter registration file. The boundary between Trinity Presbyterian and West View Elementary was also adjusted to match the county precinct map and the voter registration file.

South Dakota
------------
Election Results from South Dakota Secretary of State (https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/election-resources/election-history/2018_Election_History.aspx)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release, with the exceptions of Potter County and Yankton County from the 2010 Census VTD release.

Brookings, Brown, Hughes, Hyde, Potter, Sully, and Yankton use countywide vote centers rather than polling locations by precinct. South Dakota counties with vote centers do not record votes by precinct. For these counties, votes were apportioned to precincts based on their share of the countywide number of ballots cast by voters registered with the party of the respective candidates. When this method was tested with counties that report votes by precinct the great majority of precincts were within 4% of the actual candidate vote shares. However, a scattering of precincts deviated by as much as 12% from the actual vote shares. These precincts tend to be in either city centers or outlying areas, which reflects the fact that registered Democrats in rural precincts are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than registered Democrats in urban precincts.

Lawrence County reported absentee votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The certified precinct report from Minnehaha County adds up to about 500 fewer votes per office than the countywide totals recorded in the official state canvass.  This was evidently an oversight in which the preliminary vote count from Minnehaha County was not updated before the final state canvass.

The following modifications were made in the shapefiles to recreate the 2018 precinct boundaries.

Beadle: Replace 5 commissioner districts with 10 precincts

Several transcription errors were corrected from OpenElections using their raw results gathered from counties (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-ut/tree/master/2018%20General%20Election). OE results in Rich and Morgan Counties were based on non-final reports, which were collected from county sources.

Emery County - 8 "canvas votes" were distributed to precincts.

Weber County - 6 precincts had their results suppressed, since all cast fewer than 15 votes, for a total of 42 votes. These were distributed based on the number of votes cast and the reported vote in 2016, which was not suppressed.

Election results from the Vermont Secretary of State (https://electionarchive.vermont.gov/)
Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program

The Census VTD shapefile features city wards. However, precinct boundaries for state and federal elections are not based on city wards. They are instead defined by legislative districts wherever they cross municipal boundaries. Therefore, city wards were merged in the shapefile and cities or townships were instead split into precincts wherever necessary using the state legislative district shapefile.

Vermont has four unorganized towns whose residents cast votes in neighboring towns. These were distributed back based on voting age population in the 2018 American Community Survey. (Averill-Canaan, Buel's Gore-Huntington, Ferdinand-Brighton, Glastenbury-Shaftsbury.)
